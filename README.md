This project uses the DocuSign API to keep electronic copies of students who are taking exams in order to hold students to high standards of integrity. Our project uses facial recognition to check whether or not the user that is getting scanned is a registered student in our database. If they are, then the student will be prompted to fill out our Integrity form which fires up the DocuSign API in our website. We used PowerForms to integrate it into our application. The file of our project with the DocuSign implementation is /src/components/DocusignModal. Other Docusign set up was done with PowerForm.
